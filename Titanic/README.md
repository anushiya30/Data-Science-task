🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (Data Analysis & Visualization)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.
No machine learning models are used — the goal is to extract meaningful insights through data analysis and visual storytelling.

🎯 Objectives

. Understand the structure and quality of the dataset

. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

. Analyze survival patterns based on different features

. Visualize relationships between variables and survival rate

. Draw meaningful conclusions from the data

🔍 Data Analysis Performed

Checked dataset shape, data types, and missing values

Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, etc.)

Analyzed statistical summaries of numerical features

Grouped data based on survival, gender, class, and age

Identified trends and patterns affecting survival

📊 Data Visualization

. The following visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

. Survival count (Survived vs Not Survived)

.Survival rate by gender

. Survival rate by passenger class

. Age distribution of passengers

. These visualizations help in clearly understanding how different factors influenced survival.

🛠️ Technologies Used

. Python

. Jupyter Notebook

. Pandas

. NumPy

. Matplotlib

. Seaborn


📈 Key Insights

. Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males

. Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better survival chances

. Children had a higher survival probability compared to adults



✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization alone can provide valuable insights without applying machine learning models.
It highlights the importance of EDA as a foundational step in any data science project.
