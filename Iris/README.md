 Iris Flower Classification

The project focuses on data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

Iris dataset containing sepal and petal measurements is used.

Data analysis is performed to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Data visualization techniques are used to explore patterns among iris species.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train-test split.

A machine learning classification model is trained and evaluated.

Implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
